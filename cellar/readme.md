# Wine Cellar Sample Application #

"Backbone Cellar" is a sample application built with [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

The application allows you to browse through a list of wines, add, update, and delete wines.

This repository provides several implementations of the same application:

1. [Backbone.js + Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-cellar/tree/master/bootstrap) implementation
2. [Backbone.js Tutorial](https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-cellar/tree/master/tutorial): A four-part Backbone.js tutorial
